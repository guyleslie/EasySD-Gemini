# EasySD Development Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-05-02 (post IRQHack64-style cold-boot fix)

This file is the short planning view of the project. It tracks the current source-backed
state and the next planned work. Historical debugging transcripts live under `docs/archive/`.

---

## Current Source-Backed State (verified on PCB v3 hardware)

The following are directly supported by the current codebase and confirmed on real hardware
during the 0.7 cleanup pass:

- Cold boot does not auto-load the menu and does not hold the C64 in reset.
  `IOSetup()` drives `/RESET` HIGH from the start (IRQHack64-style); the C64
  cold-boots to BASIC on its own RC reset while `setup()` initializes SD and
  `cartApi.Init()` in parallel. Menu transfer happens only on an explicit short
  `SEL` press in `loop()`. Verified on real uEliteBoard64 (uni64.com) hardware (2026-05-02);
  see `docs/COLD_BOOT_FAILURE_RETROSPECTIVE.md` for the diagnostic history.
- `TransferMenu()` prefers `EASYSD.PRG` from the SD card root and falls back to built-in
  `cartridgeData` if the file is not present.
- Directory handling uses the firmware CWD as the source of truth, with `currentPath` kept
  as UI/debug state. `DirFunction::ResyncDirFromCwd()` resynchronizes after every chdir.
- Menu navigation uses `COMMAND_CHANGE_DIR_INDEX` for visible-row directory changes,
  avoiding stale-name and deep-stack issues on the Arduino side.
- Ordinary menu `.PRG` launches use the direct `PROGRAM` path:
  `EasySDMenu.s` dispatches to `LoadAndLaunchFile()`, the Arduino sends
  `SendHeader()` + `SendLoaderStub()`, and the C64 launch decision happens inside
  `LoaderStub.65s`.
- `LoaderStub` now performs content-based launch selection. Standard BASIC PRGs
  at `$0801` still use `CLR` + `RUN`, and hybrid PRGs loaded below `$0801` but
  containing a tokenized BASIC `SYS` stub at `$0801` are also `RUN`-launched.
  This fixes Beach Head-style files on real hardware.
- KernalBridge/P2TK remains in-tree as a separate bridge path for
  large/self-overwriting PRG workflows; it is not the default route for ordinary
  `.PRG` file selection in the current menu.
- PRG launch returns the Arduino side to a clean baseline by closing the file, disabling
  the cartridge, calling `Init()`, and starting listening again.
- Long filenames and full path handling work; recent plugin-side fixes no longer assume a
  fixed 31-byte media filename.
- **Sima MultiLoad PRG bundles** (created via `Tools/create_multiload.py` without resident
  chaining) run from `MULTILOAD/GAMENAME/` folders and are **verified working** on real HW.

---

## Known Issues (out of scope for 0.7 release)

- **MultiLoad EASYLOAD.PRG chain** — hangs after MAIN's `JMP ($008B)` with a distinctive
  fingerprint: outer border = black, inner area = blue. The colors come from the loaded
  first part starting up, not from MultiLoad MAIN. So MAIN finishes cleanly and the game
  begins executing, then dies on the first `LOAD "...",8,x` through the resident hook.
  Suspected root cause: `RL_STUB` at `$033C` (cassette buffer) is wiped by games that
  nullify `$0200-$03FF` during init.
- **WavPlayer / KoalaDisplayer / PetsciiDisplayer / CvdPlayer / HWTest** — fail on real
  hardware with various symptoms. Not re-verified on the current firmware baseline.

These are tracked in detail in `docs/PLUGIN_HARDWARE_BUGS.md`.

---

## Protocol Invariants Worth Preserving

These rules are critical for cartridge-facing plugins:

1. Start the cartridge session before file/cart operations (`PROT_StartTalking`).
2. Close opened files on all paths where open succeeded (`PROT_CloseFile`).
3. End the session on both success and failure exits (`PROT_EndTalking`).
4. Return to the menu only after session cleanup (`PROT_ExitToMenu`).

`KernalBridge` is the clearest reference implementation for this pattern.

## Planned Refactoring — Arduino Side (low priority)

`CartApi.cpp` (~1452 lines) mixes protocol dispatch, PRG loading, streaming, hardware test,
and string utilities. Splitting it improves navigability and makes each concern testable
independently. Flash/SRAM cost of splitting: zero — the linker sees the same compiled
output regardless of how many `.cpp` files the code is spread across.

**Rule per phase:** must produce identical HEX output, one phase per commit, build verified
before/after.

### Planned modules (in priority order)

| Phase | Module | Complexity | What moves out |
|-------|--------|------------|----------------|
| 1 | `HwTest.cpp/.h` | Trivial | `HandleHwTest()` and supporting helpers (~80 lines). Wrap in `#ifdef COMMAND_HWTEST` for conditional compilation. |
| 2 | `PrgLoader.cpp/.h` | Medium | `LoadAndLaunchFile`, `SendHeader`, `SendLoaderStub`, `TransferMenu`. Pass `workingFile` and `cartInterface` as references. |
| 3 (optional) | `StringUtils.h` | Trivial | `IsMatchLast`, `StartsWith` inline helpers — only if needed. |

A previously planned `TapConverter.cpp` phase is **obsolete**: TAP-to-PRG support was fully
removed in 2026-04 (commits `d42fcb8`, `8dfcf55`).

### What stays in CartApi.cpp

The protocol dispatch core: `HandleApi()`, `GetArgumentsStatic/Dynamic()`, `HandleResponse/
HandleValueResponse()`, `AwaitByte()/GetByte()`, all `Handle*()` file/dir/stream handlers,
and `Init()`.

---

## Planned Refactoring — C64 Assembly Side

### Decision: do NOT split `CartLibHi.s`

Reasons:
1. Splitting requires a new umbrella include file and updating every plugin — high churn,
   low gain.
2. The VIC-display, directory, and stream helpers are all part of one protocol-facing layer.
3. The current size alone does not justify structural churn.

### What IS worth doing in `CartLibHi.s`

- Improve English comments (some are outdated or missing).
- Document the `PROT_StartTalking` / `PROT_EndTalking` contract at the top of the file.
- Add a clear section header for each functional group (file ops, dir ops, stream).

### Plugin checklist comment

Add a plugin skeleton or checklist at the top of `CartLibHi.s` (or in a separate
`PluginTemplate.s`) to make the protocol invariant impossible to miss:

```asm
; PLUGIN PROTOCOL CHECKLIST:
;   1. JSR PROT_StartTalking          — before ANY file/cart operation
;   2. #OPENFILE / file ops / etc.
;   3. JSR PROT_CloseFile             — on ALL paths where OPENFILE succeeded
;   4. JSR PROT_EndTalking            — on ALL exit paths (success AND error)
;   5. JSR PROT_ExitToMenu            — last call before JMP *
```

## Recommended Work Sequence (post-0.7)

```
Phase 1 — EASYLOAD chain debug (highest value)
  🔲 Add canary byte at $033F to test the "RL_STUB wiped" hypothesis
  🔲 If confirmed, relocate RL_STUB out of $0200-$03FF (e.g. $C000+ via bridge)
  🔲 Add C64-side timeout to RL_WaitProcessing to mirror Arduino's 200 ms reset

Phase 2 — Media plugin re-verification
  🔲 WavPlayer: hardware-focused validation of playback modes
  🔲 KoalaDisplayer / PetsciiDisplayer: simple display path
  🔲 CvdPlayer: confirm EOF-driven NI-stream exit on hardware
  🔲 HWTest: data bus diagnostic on current firmware

Phase 3 — Arduino CartApi.cpp refactor (only if maintenance burden grows)
  🔲 Extract HwTest.cpp/.h
  🔲 Extract PrgLoader.cpp/.h

Phase 4 — C64 library comment cleanup
  🔲 CartLibHi.s: English comments, section headers, protocol invariant block
  🔲 Plugin protocol checklist / template
```
